{"name":"Oak","body":"## What is Oak?\r\nOak is about getting things done. It's about maintaining a rapid development cycle. It's about having an immediate and addictive feedback loop in place to keep you in the zone. It's about getting developers on board and getting them up and running fast so that they can start contributing. It's about reducing all aspects of development friction.\r\n\r\n## How does Oak make things awesome?\r\n- Oak is built on top of ASP.NET MVC, so you don't have to re-learn anything, just build upon what you already know.\r\n- Oak maintains a rapid development cycle by making testing easy and by providing an immediate feedack loop using Growl For Windows.  \r\n- Oak takes advantage of dynamic C# 4.0 and metaprogramming for your data access.  \r\n- Initial schema creation, seeding sample data, and regenerating database for other developers is provided directly through controller actions that can be leveraged by tests and rake scripts.  \r\n\r\n## Oak in Action\r\nHere is a screencast that shows the creation of a Blog website using Oak\r\n\r\n## First Time (Prerequisites)\r\n- Install [IIS Express](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=1038)\r\n- Install [ruby 1.9.2](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)\r\n- Install the following gems using a command prompt that supports ruby:\r\n<pre>\r\ngem install bundler\r\ngem install warmup\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n## Explore The Sample App: DynamicBlog\r\n- Run the following commands:\r\n<pre>\r\ngit clone https://github.com/amirrajan/Oak.git (or download the zip)\r\ncd \"Oak\\Sample Apps\\DynamicBlog\"\r\nstart DynamicBlog.sln\r\n</pre>\r\n- Update the connection strings in the Web.config and App.config to point to an existing database (or create a new one and update the connection strings accordingly).\r\n- Then run the commands:\r\n<pre>\r\nrake             (builds and deploys the application)\r\nrake tests       (all tests should pass)\r\nrake server      (this will start up iis express)\r\nrake reset       (resets the database schema with no data)\r\nrake sample      (adds sample data to the database)\r\nstart http://localhost:3000\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n## Explore The Reference Implementation: Borrowed Games\r\n- Run the following commands\r\n<pre>\r\ngit clone https://github.com/amirrajan/Oak.git (or download the zip)\r\ncd \"Oak\\Sample Apps\\BorrowedGames\"\r\nstart BorrowedGames.sln\r\n</pre>\r\n- Update the connection strings in the Web.config and App.config to point to an existing database (or create a new one and update the connection strings accordingly).\r\n- Then run the commands\r\n<pre>\r\nbundle install\r\nrake             (builds and deploys the application)\r\nrake tests       (all tests should pass)\r\nrake server      (this will start up iis express)\r\nrake reset       (resets the database schema with no data)\r\nrake sample      (adds sample data to the database)\r\nstart http://localhost:3000\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n## Bootstrap Your Own App With Oak\r\n- Run the following commands:\r\n<pre>\r\nwarmup http://github.com/amirrajan/loam Blog (creates a .Net solution)\r\ncd Blog\r\nbundle install (installs any ruby gems needed)\r\nrake (builds the .net app)\r\nrake server (starts iis express)\r\nstart Blog.sln (opens the solution)\r\nwatchr dotnet.watchr.rb (starts your feedback loop)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n## More Stuff\r\n- MIT License\r\n- Head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/amirrajan/oak/wiki) for additional details.\r\n- [Reference Implementations](https://github.com/amirrajan/Oak/tree/master/Sample%20Apps) are included, test driven, awesome \r\n- Built ground up [under test](https://github.com/amirrajan/Oak/tree/master/Oak.Tests)\r\n- Available via Nuget: **install-package oak or install-package oak-edge**","tagline":"Bring dynamic goodness and frictionless development to ASP .NET MVC","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
